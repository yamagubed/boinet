\description{
Conducts simulation studies of the TITE-BOIN-ET (Time-to-Event Bayesian Optimal
Interval design to accelerate dose-finding based on both Efficacy and Toxicity outcomes)
design. This advanced extension of BOIN-ET addresses the practical challenges of
late-onset outcomes and rapid patient accrual in modern oncology trials by incorporating
time-to-event information and allowing continuous enrollment without waiting for
complete outcome assessment.

The TITE-BOIN-ET design is particularly valuable for immunotherapy, targeted therapy,
and other novel agents where Late-onset toxicity is common and causes major
logistic difficulty for existing adaptive phase I trial designs, which require
the observance of toxicity early enough to apply dose-escalation rules for new patients.
}
\details{
\strong{Key Advantages:}

\strong{1. Continuous Accrual:}
Unlike standard BOIN-ET which waits for complete outcome assessment, TITE-BOIN-ET
allows continuous patient enrollment by utilizing both complete and pending (censored)
outcome data. This can significantly reduce trial duration.

\strong{2. Late-Onset Outcome Handling:}
The design explicitly models time-to-event outcomes, making it suitable for:
\itemize{
\item Immune-related adverse events that may occur months after treatment
\item Delayed efficacy responses common in immunotherapy
\item Targeted agents with cumulative toxicity effects
}

\strong{3. Flexible Assessment Windows:}
Different assessment periods for toxicity (tau.T) and efficacy (tau.E) accommodate
the reality that safety and efficacy endpoints often have different time courses.

\strong{4. Correlated Outcomes:}
The design can model correlation between toxicity and efficacy through copula
functions, reflecting the biological relationship between these endpoints.

\strong{Statistical Methodology:}

\strong{Time-to-Event Integration:}
The design uses a weighted likelihood approach where:
\itemize{
\item Complete observations receive full weight
\item Pending observations receive fractional weight based on follow-up time
\item Weight = (observation time) / (assessment window)
}

\strong{Decision Algorithm:}
At each interim analysis, the design:
\enumerate{
\item Updates outcome estimates using complete and pending data
\item Applies the same decision boundaries as BOIN-ET (lambda1, lambda2, eta1)
\item Makes dose escalation/de-escalation decisions
\item Continues enrollment while maintaining safety monitoring
}

\strong{When to Choose TITE-BOIN-ET:}
\itemize{
\item Expected late-onset toxicity
\item Delayed efficacy assessment
\item Rapid accrual
\item Trial duration is a critical constraint
}

\strong{Consider Standard BOIN-ET When:}
\itemize{
\item Outcomes occur within 2-4 weeks
\item Slow accrual allows waiting for complete data
\item Preference for simpler designs
}
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Accrual rate significantly impacts design performance and trial duration
\item Early stopping rules are critical for patient safety in TITE designs
