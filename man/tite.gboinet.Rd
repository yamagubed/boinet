\arguments{
\item{n.dose}{Integer specifying the number of dose levels to investigate.}

\item{start.dose}{Integer specifying the starting dose level (1 = lowest dose).
Generally recommended to start at the lowest dose for safety.}

\item{size.cohort}{Integer specifying the number of patients per cohort.
Commonly 3 or 6 patients, with 3 being standard for early-phase trials.}

\item{n.cohort}{Integer specifying the maximum number of cohorts.
Total sample size = size.cohort*n.cohort.}

\item{toxprob}{Matrix (nrow = toxicity categories, ncol = n.dose) specifying
true toxicity probabilities. Each column must sum to 1.0. Rows represent
ordered toxicity levels from none to most severe.}

\item{effprob}{Matrix (nrow = efficacy categories, ncol = n.dose) specifying
true efficacy probabilities. Each column must sum to 1.0. Rows represent
ordered response levels from none to best response.}

\item{sev.weight}{Numeric vector of toxicity severity weights. Length must
equal nrow(toxprob). Should be non-decreasing and reflect clinical impact.
First element typically 0 (no toxicity). Example: c(0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) for
Grade 0 and 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade 4.}

\item{res.weight}{Numeric vector of efficacy response weights. Length must
equal nrow(effprob). Should be non-decreasing and reflect clinical benefit.
First element typically 0 (no response). Example: c(0, 0.25, 1.0, 3.0) for
PD, SD, PR, CR.}

\item{phi}{Numeric target for normalized equivalent toxicity score (nETS).
Should be calibrated for weighted scores, not binary probabilities.}

\item{phi1}{Numeric lower boundary for nETS. Doses with nETS <= phi1 considered

\description{
Conducts simulation studies of the TITE-gBOIN-ET (Time-to-Event generalized
Bayesian Optimal Interval design to accelerate dose-finding accounting for ordinal
graded Efficacy and Toxicity outcomes) design. This advanced extension incorporates
both time-to-event modeling and ordinal (graded) outcome assessment, making it
suitable for modern oncology trials where both the severity of toxicity and the
degree of efficacy response are clinically meaningful.

The design addresses the reality that clinical outcomes are rarely binary. For
example, toxicity may range from mild (Grade 1) to life-threatening (Grade 4),
while efficacy can span from no response to complete response. By utilizing this
additional information, TITE-gBOIN-ET can make more informed dose selection
decisions while maintaining the advantages of time-to-event modeling for
delayed outcomes.

\details{
\strong{Key Advantages:}

\strong{1. Ordinal Outcome Modeling:}
Instead of binary toxicity/efficacy, the design uses:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Toxicity categories}: e.g., None, Mild, Moderate, Severe
\item \strong{Efficacy categories}: e.g., No Response, Partial Response, Complete Response
\item \strong{Weighted scoring}: Different severity levels receive different weights
\item \strong{Normalized equivalent scores}: nETS (toxicity) and nEES (efficacy)
}

\strong{2. Enhanced Information Utilization:}
The design captures more granular clinical information by considering:
\itemize{
\item Grade 2 toxicity as different from Grade 4 toxicity
\item Partial response as different from complete response
\item Clinically meaningful gradations within traditional binary endpoints
}

\strong{3. Flexible Weighting Schemes:}
Users can specify custom weights reflecting clinical importance:
\itemize{
\item \strong{sev.weight}: Toxicity severity weights (e.g., 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5)
\item \strong{res.weight}: Efficacy response weights (e.g., 0, 0.25, 1.0, 3.0)
}

\strong{Statistical Methodology:}

\strong{Equivalent Toxicity/Efficacy Scores:}

The design converts ordinal outcomes to continuous scores:
\itemize{
\item \strong{ETS (Equivalent Toxicity Score)}: Weighted sum of toxicity categories
\item \strong{EES (Equivalent Efficacy Score)}: Weighted sum of efficacy categories
\item \strong{Normalization}: Scores divided by maximum possible weight (nETS, nEES)
\item \strong{Decision making}: Uses normalized scores with same boundaries as binary BOIN-ET
}

\strong{Time-to-Event Integration:}
Combines ordinal scoring with time-to-event methodology:
\itemize{
\item Events can occur at different times within assessment windows
\item Partial information from censored observations
}

\strong{Matrix Input Structure:}
Probability matrices define outcome distributions:
\itemize{
\item \strong{toxprob}: Matrix where rows = toxicity categories, columns = doses
\item \strong{effprob}: Matrix where rows = efficacy categories, columns = doses
\item Row sums should equal 1 (probability distributions)
\item Allows complex, realistic outcome scenarios
}
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Probability matrices must have rows summing to 1.0 for each dose
\item Weight vectors must have same length as corresponding outcome categories
\item Normalized scores may require different target values than binary probabilities
}
